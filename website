    <p>JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is a Japanese comic series written and illustrated by Hirohiko Araki. It’s one of the most famous and influential mangas ever, which was finally adapted into an anime in 2012. JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure is one the most outrageous and joyous series I have ever watched.</p>
    <p>JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure is the story of the Joestar family, starting with Jonathan, a mild-mannered Englishman who strikes up a rivalry with Dio Brando, his adopted brother. Because of a cursed mask, Dio becomes a powerful vampire, and Jonathan swears to stop him.
    After learning a fighting move called the “Ripple”, which allows Jonathan to kill vampires by punching the sun into them, he goes on a quest to defeat Dio for good.
    </p>
    <p>
    Each arc of the manga and anime follows the life of another member of the Joestar family, tracing their adventures through the generations.  
    </p> 
    <p>After Jonathan comes his grandson Joseph, who must defeat the vampiric Pillar Men, and then his grandson Jotaro Kujo, who develops a Stand and goes on an international trip to finally kill Dio.
    Each of the eight arcs of the series takes a new Joestar descendent on a dramatic new quest, each one exploring a new and more inventive setting and genre of storytelling.
    After globetrotting with Jotaro, we join Joseph’s illegitimate son Josuke in the small town of Morioh and track down a Stand-using serial killer. Next comes Giorno Giovanna’s mafia story in Italy, then Jolyne Cujoh’s jailbreak, then a deadly horse race set in an alternate universe, and most recently, the Pygmalion tale of another Josuke.
    </p>
    <p>
     Describing what JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure is about is much harder than describing its pedigree. You owe it to yourself to experience it.

      Joestar Family :
     </h2>
     <div class="w3-panel w3-leftbar">
      <p><i>"I can tell since I watched those three men who carried the blood of the Joestar Family in their veins back in Morioh. The three of them emanate righteousness from their hearts as if it gave them energy... Without a doubt the blood that flows through Giorno's veins also carries the will of the Joestars."</i></p>

     <p>
      The Joestar Family is the main family featured in the JoJo's Bizarre Adventure series, of which each of the protagonists of the series is a part of. 
      It is a powerful family with English roots; most of its members attract particular trials and tribulations when confronting the supernatural.
      The Joestar family has had a rich history and each of its members have had wildly different lives from each others. One of their key features are a star-shaped birthmark above their left shoulder blade.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Joestar family is considerably connected to the supernatural, several of its members meeting with supernatural creatures and combating fantastical threats with varying degrees of willingness. 
      The family's earlier members can count among them a high number of Ripple users, but Joseph was their final representative. Afterwards, each of the Joestars became a Stand user, all blessed with potent Stand abilities. 
      The most prominent members of the family throughout the generations have had a tendency to have alliterative names, earning them the shared moniker of "JoJo".

     <h2>
      Stand :
     </h2>
     <p>
      A Stand is a supernatural power unique to JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.
     </p>
     <p>
      A Stand is an entity psychically generated by its proprietor, generally referred to as a Stand Master. It is viewed as a visual manifestation of the User's fighting spirit. 
      A Stand generally presents itself as a figure hovering over or near the user and possesses abilities beyond that of an ordinary human, which, depending on the Stand User, can be wielded for good or evil.
      According to Joseph Joestar, the name "Stand" comes from the fact they usually manifest standing next to the User: Standing by your side and ready to act.
